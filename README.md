# Advance_Computer_Programming_Final_Project
From the advance computer programming (2190102), what I do the project is a searching and adding book app. I would like to help the librarian and the user to find or search book easily. I use ionic framework along with angularjs to make a demo of hybrid application, and I also use the chartjs to give more information to the user. For the server-side framework, I use flask as my backend framework.
